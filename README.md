# Emotion_Classification_BERT
 Developed a text classification model to identify emotions in Twitter posts using BERT. The project involved loading and cleaning a Twitter emotion dataset, implementing a custom TensorFlow model with bert-base-uncased from Hugging Face's Transformers library, and training the model to classify tweets into six emotions.
